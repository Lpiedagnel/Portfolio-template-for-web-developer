# Portfolio template for web developer

When is was looking for a free template portfolio, I found many of them uses Jquery, Bootstrap or both of them. So I decided to code my own template without them.

If you are looking for a template, you can use this one whatever you want.

## Instructions

- This template uses vanilla Javascript, so he doesn't need any dependencies except SASS for styling.

- He uses BEM naming convention for classes and ID. For SASS, the folders follow the rules 7-1.

- For the animations on scroll: you can add `hidden` class on whatever element you want to animate. This class changes the opacity, and add blur and transitionX effects. If you want to add a delay (to animate card, for example), you can add `transition-delay` on the css of the element.

Happy coding!
